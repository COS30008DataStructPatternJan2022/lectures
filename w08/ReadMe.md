# Object life time
(Lipman, Chapter 6)

Every object has an associated lifetime.
- **Nonstatic objects** that are defined inside a block exist from when their definition is encountered until the end of the block in which they are defined. 
- **Global objects**: created during program startup.
- **Local static objects**: created before the first time execution passes through the objectâ€™s definition. 
- **Global objects**, **local static objects**: are destroyed when the `main` function ends.

# Program memory
(Lipman, Chapter 12)
- **static memory**: static objects & vars defined outside of any function
- **stack memory**: nonstatic objects inside a function
- **heap memory** (a.k.a free store): objects that program dynamically allocates at run-time.
  - e.g. when using the `new` keyword to create an object
  - program must control dynamic objects (to destroy them when they are not used)
  - easier said than done! (helped in C++11 by smart pointers)

## C++ call stack explanation

- Video 1: https://youtu.be/uG_JOJgwbco, visual explanation of:
   - call stack, frames, heap, automatic and dynamic objects/variables
   - the `new`, `delete` keywords
- Text explanation: https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/419/notes/frames.html
- Video 2: https://youtu.be/aCPkszeKRa4
  - visual explanation of call stack, using recursion to illustrate

# SimpleString implementation
- include library `#include <cstring>` to use function `strlen`
- strings are terminated by a null character `\0`, which is not counted in the string length
  - i.e. an empty string is the string containing `\0`

# Reference count
- Alternative to the lecture slide's method is the use of C++11's **smart pointer**:
  - See Lippman et al, Section 12.1 (dynamic memory and smart pointers)
  - code example in folder: `refcount`
- **Mark and Sweep**: a garbage collection algorithm
  - one of the commonly-used GC techniques: [see this note for details](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/lectures/lecture17.pdf)
